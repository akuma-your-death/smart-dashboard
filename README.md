# smart-dashboard Version: 0.1.2
imaginations for 1.0.0 update:
+ more things possible to do
+ replacement for txt files to one big json file

0.1.2 updates (2022-24-10):
+ tells you if gateway isnt right
+ works for linux but not automaticly

0.1.1 updates (2022-23-10):
+ auto ping-test (html file)
+ now you can set new nmap target without waiting till the website loads (target will be scaned after homenetwork)
- still doesnt working for linux

0.1.0 updates (2022-23-10):
+ better look (html file)
+ bug fix with nmap
- still doesnt working with linux

this is my first python tool i would love feedback and new ideas.
Run only dashboard.py the rest will be created and run by themself
On Linux you have to run run-if-linux.sh or run manuelly dashboard.py, nmap.py and server.py (i'll add this bash file in 0.1.3 update (notice on 2022-25/27-10))

if you install the requirements.txt its not a problem if you get only errors, these tools should be install by standard but just to be safe
