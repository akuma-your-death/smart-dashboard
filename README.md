# smart-dashboard Version: 0.2

0.2 updates:
+ better look (html file)
+ bug fix with nmap
- still doesnt working on linux

this is a python tool.
Its the first version so its not the best.
I will update the HTML content with css and add some more things to use.

Run only dashboard.py the rest will be created and run be themself
