# smart-dashboard
Version: 0.2
+ + better look (html file)
+ + bug fix with nmap
- - still doesnt working on linux

this is a python tool.
Its the first version so its not the best.
I will update the HTML content with css and add some more things to use.

Run only dashboard.py the rest will be created and run be themself

im not sure if its works on Linux and termux but i try my best to update it
